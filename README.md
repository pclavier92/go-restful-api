# go-restful-api

Simple example of an api using [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) as the project structure and a wrapper of [gin-gonic/gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) as its HTTP web framework.

This example is based on joaquinlpereyra's go projects, most of the /pkg folder wrapper are his owns, so thanks for such a nice work joaquito!
